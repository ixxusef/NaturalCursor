> Human-behavior utilities for Playwright enabling low-detectability browser automation.

---

## Why I Made This

Modern bot detection systems can't use traditional detection anymore. With modern emulation libraries like Playwright, they now have to look for **unrealistic input**.

Playwright provides amazing speed and control, but default automation behavior is:
- linear
- timed
- inhuman

This library provides **human-behavior primitives** that make automated browser interactions smoother in an efficient, scalable way.

## Features

- Human-like mouse movement (curves, overshoot, correction)
- Realistic typing (delays, typos, corrections)
- Natural timing variance and idle input
- Cursor state tracking
- Drop-in Playwright compatibility
- Modular utilities — use only what you need
